Extension methods for creating chronology objects like `TimeSpan` or `DateTime` that read more natural.


## TimeSpan

Add the following extension methods on `int` and `double` that allow creating a `TimeSpan`:
- `.Milliseconds()`
- `.Seconds()`
- `.Minutes()`
- `.Hours()`
- `.Days()`

```csharp
// ↓ Using traditional creation of TimeSpan
TimeSpan timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
TimeSpan timeout = 10.Seconds();
// ↑ Using the extension methods from this library
```

It is also possible to combine multiple extension methods:
```csharp
TimeSpan timeout = 1.Minutes(30.Seconds());
```


## DateTime

Add extension methods on `int` for each month that allow creating a `DateTime`:

```csharp
// ↓ Using traditional creation of DateTime
DateTime time = new DateTime(2024, 12, 24);
DateTime time = 24.December(2024);
// ↑ Using the extension methods from this library
```

It is also possible to specify a time:
```csharp
DateTime time = 24.December(2024).At(18, 30);
```

It is also possible combine this with the `TimeSpan` extensions:
```csharp
DateTime time = 3.Hours().Before(25.December(2024));
```
